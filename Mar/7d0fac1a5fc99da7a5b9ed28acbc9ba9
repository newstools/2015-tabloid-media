Actor Vin Diesel says the tension on the sets of `Fast and Furious 7` was deadly as Jason Statham, the latest to join the franchise, and their characters were required to be in physical face-offs most of the time. &#8220;The scenes where we are intense with one another were not the most enjoyable scenes on the set, because there was a tension that was present. For the more physical face-offs, we had started training a month early,` Diesel said in a statement. &#8220;Thank god we&#8217;re friends and we are rooting for each other in real life because the intensity that we had to build against one another was so deadly,` he added.
