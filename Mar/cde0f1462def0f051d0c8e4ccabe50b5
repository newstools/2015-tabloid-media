Actress Sofia Vergara says she and her finance Joe Manganiello are yet to decide any wedding date. In an earlier interview, Manganiello, 38, had said that they have set a wedding date, and there was also news that their wedding had been postponed. But in an interview on TV show &#8220;Extra&#8221;, Vergara has laughed off the talks, reports aceshowbiz.com. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, how can something be postponed when it has never been set? It&#8217;s really funny. It&#8217;s always a lot of fun for girls to plan the wedding. Yes all of my friends are planning,&#8221; she said. Vergara got engaged to Manganiello on Christmas Day last year.
