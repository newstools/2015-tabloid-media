Actress Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have reportedly been spending a lot of time together for over a year, but it&#8217;s nothing serious. Sources don&#8217;t expect Holmes to take things to the next level with Foxx, reports people.com.&#8221;This is not some intense romance. Jamie and Katie are friends and have been for a long time. They are two adults who are attractive and single, and so apparently conclusions will be drawn. But contrary to those conclusions, they&#8217;re not about to run off and make some serious commitment,&#8221; the source said. Another insider said that Holmes has been &#8220;often&#8221; spotted visiting Foxx at his nearby home. They are said to &#8220;spend hours together&#8221; at a time.
