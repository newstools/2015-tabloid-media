With the entire focus on Sunny Leone in &#8216;Ek Paheli Leela&#8217;, male actors Jay Bhanushali, Mohit Ahlawat and Rajniesh Duggal are supposedly feeling left out. Sunny Leone might be raising the temperature with her oomph in her upcoming film, &#8216;Ek Paheli Leela&#8217;, but her male co-stars are feeling the heat -literally.Buzz is that Jay Bhanushali, Mohit Ahlawat and Rajniesh Duggal, who feature in prominent roles in the Bobby Khan film, feel that they have been sidelined. The posters only feature Sunny with not even a miniscule snapshot of the trio. The guy brigade has apparently been throwing a fit and making their displeasure known to the makers.
