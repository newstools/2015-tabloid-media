Tonight at around 19h00 Netcare 911 and several emergency services received a call for a multiple car pileup with several people shot on the P198 in Umtentweni. Exact detail to the cause of the crash and preceding events is still speculative and will remain a subject for police investigation. Reports from the scene however indicate that there was a shootout before the vehicles collided into each other.&#8220;The driver of the bakkie, 29, was travelling with two occupants when a Toyota Run X approached them while they were stationary at the traffic lights and fired a number of shots,&#8221; Brigadier Jay Naicker said. He said three other vehicles collided into each other during the shooting.&#8220;Paramedics arrived at the scene and found &#8220;absolute carnage with accident debris and the twisted frame of the vehicles obstructing the roadway&#8221;, Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said.&#8220;The injured had not just sustained injuries from the crash but had sustained multiple gunshot wounds.&#8221;After triaging the injured it was found that two people had sustained life-threatening injuries while three others were in a serious condition. Paramedics from several services worked fervently to stabilise the injured at the scene before they transported them to various hospitals in the area for the care that they required. One of the critically wounded people tragically died at the scene despite the efforts from paramedics to resuscitate him.
