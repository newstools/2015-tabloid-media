In the interest of keeping your money safe, SAPS would like to warn the community to be very vigilant of scams and not to enter into any conversation over the phone where personal and private information is requested from you, especially with regard to your bank account number and identity number.SAPS Major Thulani Zwane would like to bring to the attention of the public a scam which has been reported in the area called the &#8220;sim swap&#8221; scam. With this scam, a person receives a call over their cell phone where the caller convinces the person that the call is from a cell phone service provider. The suspects claim that the person&#8217;s sim card is problematic and that they require their identity number and other personal details in order to rectify the problem.The person is warned that while they sort out the problem the sim card will be out of order for a short amount of time. A short while later the person finds that their cell phone does not work. What the person only later discovers is that a sim swap has been done and banking transactions have taken place which they have not authorised. In some instances the person will later discover that small loans have also been taken out on the person s name, said Zwane.Zwane also warned to never disclose the fact that you have money in a bank account to a stranger or anyone else and never entrust your money to strangers who approach you on the street.
