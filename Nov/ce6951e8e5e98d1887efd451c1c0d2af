By Claudine SenekalPublic Safety Superintendent, Freddie Halgreen from the Okhahlamba Municipality, rescued an abandoned baby-boy from a pit toilet, in the Ketani area,Winterton, early this morning, 25 November. Frantic locals reported to him that a baby was in the pit-toilet. While I was making my way down the pit-toilet, the baby started crying, said Halgreen. He never thought he could move so fast to get to the small crying baby, he explained. The officer wrapped the little baby-boy and immediately rushed him to the Emmuas Hospital. I made a phone call later to the hospital and found out that the baby is still alive, I m happy to hear such good news, Halgreen added.Winterton police are investigating a case of abandonment and neglect.
