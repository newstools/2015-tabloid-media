Stand-up comedian Masood Boomgaard will be paying back the funny with his hilarious commentary on living in South Africa, I m Chooning You, Ekse!Masood is well known for his humorous yet hard hitting views everything from Politics to Sport to parenting. In I m Chooning You we see him find the funny in issues that part of parcel of the lives of everyday South Africans, regardless of race, religion or political affiliation. At the top of Masood s list is the state of the economy, crime, illegal immigration and the taxi industry.Masood will explain how the worsening rand-dollar exchange rate has sent illegals running back for the border fence, why South Africa is now even too unsafe for criminals, why we soon could have a Pakistani president and why we need to convince taxi drivers that indicators did not go out with Apartheid. Oh and lets not forget Juju and his red beret brigade. Boomgaard says that his comedy is pitched at the everyday man.I talk about personal experience but also about what people are interested in. I talk about things that millions of South Africans discuss with their friends and families every day. I just try to talk about these things in a different way. I try and find the funny side.Personally I d like to get a big fat juicy tender, quipped Masood. A housing one would be nice. I ve never actually built a house but I know a guy who once built a house out of Lego. That should in theory qualify me. I m Chooning You, Ekse takes place at the Catalina Theatre, Wilson s Wharf 20/21November and 27/28 November at 8pm. Tickets are R80 and are available from Computicket and Shoprite.
