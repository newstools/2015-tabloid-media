Kangna Ranaut will be teaming up with her mentor, filmmaker Anurag Basu, after a gap of eight years. The actress made her Bollywood debut with his film &#8216;Gangster&#8217; (2006) and then in his slice-of-life flick &#8216;Life In A&#8230; Metro&#8217; (2007). The two recently met and discussed a project. Though in the initial stages, the film is said to be a love story. A source says, &#8220;Kangna may not have worked with him for the past eight years, but they share a warm personal rapport. When Anurag spoke about a script he had in mind, she instantly gave him her nod.&#8221; As Anurag is currently busy with his Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif-starrer &#8216;Jagga Jasoos&#8217;, his film with Kangna will roll only after he wraps up his present assignment.
