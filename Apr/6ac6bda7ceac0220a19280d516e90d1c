Singer Zayn Malik has announced that he is quitting band One Direction to lead a &#8220;normal&#8221; life out of the spotlight. The 22-year-old skipped the group&#8217;s world tour last week due to stress, reports femalefirst.co.uk. `My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I&#8217;d like to apologise to the fans if I&#8217;ve let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart,` Malik said in a statement. `I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world,` he added.
