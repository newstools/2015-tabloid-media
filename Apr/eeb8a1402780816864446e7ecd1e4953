Actor Salman Khan, giving his version of a 2002 hit-and-run case for the first time in a court last Friday, said he was not driving the SUV that ran over people sleeping on a pavement in Mumbai, his driver Ashok Singh was. One person was killed and four people were injured in the accident. The actor, 49, took off his earrings before walking up to the witness box in a Mumbai sessions court. He denied his bodyguard Ravindra Patil&#8217;s statement that despite warnings he drove his Toyota Land Cruiser at a high speed, in a drunk state, in the early hours of September 28, 2002, and lost control. He admitted to sitting on the driver&#8217;s seat only briefly when one driver got out and another, Ashok Singh, took over.
