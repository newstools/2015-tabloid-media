By Se-Anne Rall One of the pioneers of South African comedy will return to our sunny shores for his latest show, BeSpoke. Stuart Taylor has been in the funny business for well over a decade. From his magic antics back in 1990, Taylor has come a long way and produced a number of hilarious shows, including his last offering, Money&#8217;s Too Tight To Mention. Since the show, Stuart has released the Learner Husband handbook and has been writing lots of material. &#8220;I have also been spreading my wings internationally, with festival performances in Switzerland and Edinburgh, as well as playing in some clubs in the US. I also made my directorial debut at the National Arts Festival last year,&#8221; Taylor said.Talking about his new show, Stuart said he was inspired by his current experiences. &#8220;The show however also has many sections with room for improvisation. That being said, no 2 shows are the same. I chat the the crowd, they chat to me, and we make some magic together,&#8221; he said. Stuart believes that from BeSpoke, the audience will see that it is more a comedy club experience in a theatre. &#8220;There is more gags than theme. I wanted to move away from the more theatrical themed material &amp; put onstage what I bring to my comedy club performances &#8211; an uncensored, anything can happen , laugh out loud night out for anyone with a good sense of humour,&#8221; he added.Regarding the future of comedy, Taylor said; &#8220;The industry is in great hands with really funny acts coming through.&#8221; &#8220;We ve got a great many fearless voices which is awesome. I think the industry will continue to grow and become a real world player. The belief in the past was that you had American comics and British comics, but in the past five or six years, we ve seen great voices come from Africa, Germany and even Russia. I think the world is becoming more of a village and SA is becoming an equal player on that stage,&#8221; he said. Commenting on a major achievement accomplished by a fellow SA funny man, Trevor Noah, Taylor said he is blown away by Noah&#8217;s &#8220;sheer audacity to strive for and achieve what he has. &#8220;It s a great bit of inspiration for anyone with a dream.Once again, it places a spotlight on a voice from Africa, and specifically SA so that s always great for this industry,&#8221; he said. BeSpoke will be running at the Elizabeth Theatre from 14 &#8211; 26 April (Tuesdays to Saturdays at 7:30pm). Tickets are R120 and are available from Computicket.
