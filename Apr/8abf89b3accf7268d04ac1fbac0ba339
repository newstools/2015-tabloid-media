One of the freeze-frames of the otherwise forgettable World Cup semi-final match between India and Australia last Thursday at the Sydney Cricket Ground was the reaction of Anushka Sharma, Bollywood&#8217;s rising star, when vice captain &#8212; and ace run-getter &#8212; Virat Kohli got out after scoring just one run. TV cameras showed Anushka, who is known to be in a relationship with Virat and had travelled to Australia to watch the much-anticipated match, burying her face in her hands as a dejected Kohli walked back to the pavilion to begin the Indian slide to defeat.
